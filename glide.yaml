  # it's hardly friendly to depend on a particular hash,
  # but this may be the only thing which will work reliably
  # for now. This hash represents the current head of
  # the master branch, which is right now some 8 months
  # and 300 commits newer than the newest release.
  # It would be great if it had a proper release, but
  # for now, at least this compiles.
  #
  # Also, we're aliasing this to our own fork of the repo
  # for now. Long-term, once we start officially supporting
  # our fork, we should probably just rename it and use it
  # directly, but for now this is the fast path to victory.
